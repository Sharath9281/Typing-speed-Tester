# Typing Speed Test Web Application

A fully functional, responsive web application built with **Python Flask** that allows users to test their typing speed and accuracy on randomly generated paragraphs. This app tracks **Words Per Minute (WPM)**, **accuracy**, **typed characters**, and **time elapsed** in real-time, providing an engaging and interactive typing practice experience.

## Project Overview

The Typing Speed Test app is designed to help users improve their typing speed and accuracy through practice. Upon loading the app, users are presented with a randomly generated paragraph of text. They start the test by clicking on the text and typing it out. The app tracks how many words are typed per minute and how accurate the typing is compared to the target text. It also displays time elapsed and character count in real-time.

This project demonstrates core web development skills, including frontend-backend integration using Flask, dynamic DOM manipulation with JavaScript, and styling with Bootstrap and FontAwesome. It also introduces users to Python web frameworks, templating with Jinja2, and managing static files.

## Features

- **Random Paragraph Generation:** Every test uses a unique paragraph to ensure varied practice.  
- **Real-time Metrics:** Continuously updated Words Per Minute (WPM), accuracy percentage, time elapsed, and character count.  
- **Visual Feedback:** Correctly typed characters highlight in black, mistakes glow red, enhancing user awareness.  
- **User Controls:** Start, end, and reset test buttons for flexible test management.  
- **Responsive UI:** Clean and mobile-friendly interface built with Bootstrap 5.  
- **Results Modal:** Summary of the final WPM, accuracy, total time, and characters typed after completing a test.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed ([Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))  
- Git installed ([Download here](https://git-scm.com/downloads))  

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/typing-speed-test.git
cd typing-speed-test
```
### Step 2: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

Creating a virtual environment keeps your project dependencies isolated and manageable.

- **On Windows (Command Prompt):**

  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **On macOS/Linux:**
   ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
   ```
### Step 3: Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
###Step 4: Run the Flask Application

Start your Flask development server by running:

```bash
python app.py
```
You should see output similar to:
```csharp
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
###Step 5: Access the Application

Open your web browser and navigate to:
```cpp
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
```yaml
